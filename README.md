# Puzzles

A small collection of puzzle experiments.

Each folder contains a self contained puzzle build. These are exploratory projects focused on interaction, mechanics, and constraints rather than polished products.

No roadmap. No guarantees. Just things I'm building.

## Structure

```
/puzzles
  /profile-puzzle-game
```

## profile-puzzle-game

A sliding tile puzzle.

You can optionally sign in and turn your profile photo into the puzzle image. Built as a lightweight demo to explore interaction, image tiling, and simple game mechanics.

## Notes

These projects are intentionally small. They may change, break, or stop evolving at any time.
